# ConnectFour
The Connect Four game was created using the Java programming language and implemented using object-oriented programming principles. The game board and its functionality, including the placement of tokens and checking for wins, were implemented using classes and object interactions.

In addition to the traditional two-player game mode, an AI player was also implemented. The AI player has the ability to both defend against the player's potential wins and also make strategic moves to try and win the game. The AI player's decision making process was implemented using a combination of logical statements and randomization.
